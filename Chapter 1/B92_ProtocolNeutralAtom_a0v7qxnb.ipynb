    "Cybersecurity is one of the most important aspects of any organization in the modern era. It protects sensitive information for all kinds of people in an organization. Whether it is your banking information, social media credentials, or email, it is all protected by an important aspect of cybersecurity: Cryptography. Cryptography is the method of using math to disguise information and make it almost impossible to undisguise. These methods for protecting our information are done behind the scenes, making the everyday person feel confident online, without needing to be a math or computer science wizard."

    "As quantum computing and quantum photonics become more advanced, one of the many pratical applications will be in Cryptography. As it turns out, the  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem\">Quantum No-Cloning Theorem</a> creates very nice security blanket for quantum cryptography protocols. This theorem states that you cannot create a copy of an arbitrary, unknown quantum state. That is, if you were to receive the $|+\\rangle$ state, you cannot create a copy of this state, because you would need to measure the state, collapsing the state to either $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$. The only way to copy the state would be if the person that sent you the $|+\\rangle$ state, told you what it was, allowing you to prepare another $|+\\rangle$ state (but you don't want to disclose what that original state is)."

    "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution\">Quantum Key Distribution</a> (QKD) is the way that we take advantage of the no-cloning theorem to send ecrypted messages. Essentially, one party will send a number of quantum states to the other party, then will simulatenously create a private key and check if their quantum communication channel has an eavesdropper present. They will then decide on the final private key, and finally encode their message with said key. Since quantum states cannot be cloned, an eavesdropper will not be able to copy the states sent through the quantum channel between the two partie. Irregularities in the states being sent will be considered corrupted, and these states will be thrown out. That is really amazing because classically, you cannot tell if someone else is in your communication channel, but now, you can tell if someone is looking at your information. That is why quantum key distribution is considered one of the most promising forms of cybersecurity in the future."

    "The B92 Protocol is one of the most popular forms of quantum key distribution, behind the BB84 protocol, that does not use quantum entanglement (that's a story for another day). This protocol uses two non-orthogonal bases, for example, the $X$ and $Z$ bases. It is known to be more secure than BB84 because of that fact, meaning less final states are accepted. However, that also means that it is not a very efficient method since a majority of quantum states that are sent will be thrown out. Typically around $25\\%$ of states are kept for the final key, meaning that if you wanted to have a 25 bit key, you would need to send around 100 quantum states."

    "To start, Alice will generate a random bit string of $0$ 's and $1$ 's (size depends on how long of a message she wants to send). A $0$ will correspond to a $|0\\rangle$, and a $1$ will correspond to a $|+\\rangle$. Alice will then send all these states to Bob via a quantum channel. Bob will now generate his own random bit string, where $0$ will correspond to measuring a state in the $Z$ basis, and $1$ corresponds to measuring in the $X$ basis. Once Bob has measured each state using his basis choices, he will communicate to Alice over a classical channel which positions in the string of states he measured to be $|1\\rangle$ ( $|1\\rangle$ is the least frequent measurement and can still be measured from either original state $|0\\rangle$ or $|+\\rangle$). Finally, Alice will keep her original bits at the positions where $|1\\rangle$ was measured, and Bob will keep the opposite of his original bit string at those positions (so it matches Alice's final string). Now, they have the private key made to encode information for a classical channel.\n",

    "However, we typically take one last security measure, and pick a few positions from the private key and discuss what they are over the classical channel. Naturally, these positions will be deleted since they were publically dicussed, but this part of the process can detect if there was an eavesdropper in the quantum channel. If the positions they dicussed were the same (Bob's key being exactly opposite of Alice's), things are all good. If there is no tampering with the quantum states, eavesdroppers or errors, the bits should match. If any of the bits do not match, they will throw away the entire private key, assuming there was an eavesdropper, and start the process over again."

Notice how you never measure $|1\\rangle$ with $100\\%$ chance. This is on purpose, so that the least amount of states are finally selected, increasing security of the protocol. Finally, noticed the three positions where a $|1\\rangle$ was measured. Alice's bit was chosen as the bit for the private key, 010, and Bob's bit should be the exact opposite of this bit, 101. Bob will flip all his bits, so that him and Alice share the same key. If Bob flips these bits and gets something other than Alice's key, we know there was an eavesdropper in the channel."
